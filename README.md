# raftlabs-assignment

The code for the assignment is located in the master section .

I have completed the assignment . the code for the solution of assignment two is located in algo.js and the visual representation of the chessboard is located in algo.html

apart from the assignment two I have made the UI of three APIs with react and the code for those is located in the frontend section. Following are the APIs for which I have made UI . 1 Add a book 2 Add a magazine 3 Get all the books and magazines sorted by title.

I have made a seperate csv folder to store the csv data and our APIs read data from this csv file and the api which you asked to write data into csv also appends this csv file
